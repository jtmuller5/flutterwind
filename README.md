# Flutterwind

Flutterwind is a UI component library that bridges the gap between Flutter and React, leveraging the power and simplicity of Tailwind CSS. It's designed to provide a seamless experience for developers familiar with Flutter, allowing them to utilize a similar component structure in their React applications.

## Benefits

- **Familiarity**: Emulates Flutter's widget system, making it intuitive for Flutter developers to build React applications.
- **Efficiency**: Speeds up the development process with a set of pre-designed, customizable components.
- **Consistency**: Ensures UI consistency across your application with Tailwind CSS integration.
- **Responsiveness**: Tailwind CSS integration means every component is responsive and adaptable to various screen sizes.

## Installation

To use Flutterwind in your project, install the package via npm:

```bash
npm install flutterwind
```

Or via yarn:

```bash
yarn add flutterwind
```

## Usage

Add the Flutterwind styles to your app:
```
import 'flutterwind/dist/style.css'
```

Here's a quick example to get you started with Flutterwind:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { Row, Column, Button } from 'flutterwind';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <Column className="p-4">
      <Row className="mb-2">
        <Button label="Click Me" onPressed={() => alert('Button clicked!')} />
      </Row>
      {/* Add more Flutterwind components here */}
    </Column>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

## Components

Flutterwind includes a variety of components such as:

- `Row` and `Column` for layout control.
- `Button`, `IconButton`, `Checkbox`, etc., for user interaction.
- `Card`, `Dialog`, `AppBar`, and more for designing your UI.

Each component is customizable with Tailwind CSS classes for a familiar styling approach.
